    You have set up the run to read in soil types based on 
 Lat/Lon.  This overrides the option to use user defined   
 sand and clay fractions- the DEFAULT SOIL PARAMETERS WILL 
 BE USED. To use the NL%SLXCLAY and NL%SLXSAND options, set
 NL%ISOILFLG to 2 and define the soil type through NL%NLSCON
